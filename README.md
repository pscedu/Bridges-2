# Bridges-2
This repo contains software developed to support the Bridges-2 platform at the [Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center](https://psc.edu) ([PSC](https://psc.edu)). Bridges-2 expands and extend concepts proven in [Bridges](https://psc.edu/resources/computing/bridges) and [Bridges-AI](https://psc.edu/bridges-ai-early-user-guide) to provide transformative capability for rapidly-evolving, computationally-intensive and data-intensive research, creating opportunities for collaboration and convergence research. Bridges-2 supports converged high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and Big Data, emphasizing ease of access for nontraditional uses of HPC, researcher productivity (through an extremely flexible user and software environment and interactivity), and providing an extensible architecture for interoperation with complementary data-intensive projects, campus resources, and clouds. Bridges-2 is supported by [NSF award number 1928147](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928147).
