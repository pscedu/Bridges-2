# Bridges-2
This repo contains software developed to support the Bridges-2 platform at the [Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center](https://psc.edu) ([PSC](https://psc.edu)).
Bridges-2 converges high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and Big Data, expanding and extending concepts proven in [Bridges](https://psc.edu/resources/computing/bridges) and [Bridges-AI](https://psc.edu/bridges-ai-early-user-guide) to provide transformative capability for rapidly-evolving, computationally-intensive and data-intensive research, creating opportunities for collaboration and convergence research.
Bridges-2 emphasizes ease of access for nontraditional uses of HPC and researcher productivity by providing a extremely flexible user and software environment and interactivity, a variety of compute nodes that are optimized for different kinds of jobs and different aspects of workflows, and high-performance, unified access to all data through a parallel filesystem that's equally accessible from all compute nodes.
Bridges-2 is an extensible architecture for interoperation with complementary data-intensive projects, campus resources, and clouds.

Bridges-2 is supported by [NSF award number 1928147](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928147) and led by Nick Nystrom (PI/PD), Paola Buitrago (Co-PI and Director of AI & Data Science), Sergiu Sanielevici (Co-PI and Director of User Support), and Robin Scibek (Co-PI and Director of Broader Impacts).
